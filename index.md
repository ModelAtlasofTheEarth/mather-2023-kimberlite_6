abstract: Kimberlites are sourced from thermochemical upwellings which can transport
  diamonds to the surface of the crust. The majority of kimberlites preserved at the
  Earth’s surface erupted between 250 and 50 million years ago, and have been attributed
  to changes in plate velocity or mantle plumes. However, these mechanisms fail to
  explain the presence of strong subduction signatures observed in some Cretaceous
  kimberlites. This raises the question whether there is a subduction process that
  unifies our understanding of the timing of kimberlite eruptions. We develop a novel
  formulation for calculating subduction angle based on trench migration, convergence
  rate, slab thickness and density to connect the influx of slab material into the
  mantle with the timing of kimberlite eruptions. We find that subduction angles combined
  with peaks in slab flux predict pulses of kimberlite eruptions. High rates of subducting
  slab material trigger mantle return flow that stimulates fertile reservoirs in the
  mantle. These convective instabilities transport slab-influenced melt to the surface
  at a distance inbound from the trench corresponding to the subduction angle. Our
  deep-time slab dip formulation has numerous potential applications including modelling
  the deep carbon and water cycles, and an improved understanding of subduction-related
  mineral deposits.
